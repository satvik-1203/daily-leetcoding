# All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, the value of a target node target, and an integer k, return an array of the values of all nodes that have a distance k from the target node.
You can return the answer in any order.

```showLineNumbers
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], target = 5, k = 2
Output: [7,4,1]
Explanation: The nodes that are a distance 2 from the target node (with value 5) have values 7, 4, and 1.
```

## Solution

This question looks similar to **find all nodes at k distance from the root node**. The inputs given to us are the root node, target node, and k. Getting the children from the target node of k distance is straightforward. But the tricky part is getting the siblings or other indirect relationships from the target node. From the following example above, if the target node is 5, locating node one is the tricky part. We can do this question in several ways: by making a parent pointer or by storing all the nodes we visited. Both these methods felt terrible to me, so I came up with a completely different approach.

We make a parent pointer to help us backtrack to the parent node from any given node. But this is unnecessary. Why? You may ask. When you understand how the call stack and recursion work in-depth, the program does all the backtracking. For example: In the tree given below,

If we call the DFS function at node one, we will first go to the left child. If we make a return statement, we will return to the parent node of the left child. Watch the video above to explain better the concept I'm presenting here.

To solve this problem, I DFS from the root till I reach the target node. Once I get the target node, I'll find all the k-distance children from it and add them to the answers array.

Then to get the other indirect node from the target node, I'll maintain k depth. For example: at target node 5, we have a k of 2, and check for all nodes that are at depth 2 from target node. And at node 3, we have k of 1. So we check for all children at depth 1, but the only catch is we check it only on the right side of 3 and not the left. We only check it on the right side because we got the k from the left side, and vice versa; If we got the k from the right side, we only check it on the left side. The code would be something like this.

```js showLineNumbers
if (node == target) {
  stepDown(target, givenK, ans);

  return givenK - 1;
}

const leftLevel = dfs(node.left, target, givenK, ans);
const rightLevel = dfs(node.right, target, givenK, ans);

if (leftLevel == 0 || rightLevel == 0) {
  ans.push(node.val);

  return null;
}

if (leftLevel != null) {
  stepDown(node.right, leftLevel - 1, ans);
  return leftLevel - 1;
}

if (rightLevel != null) {
  stepDown(node.left, rightLevel - 1, ans);
  return rightLevel - 1;
}
```

The primary three functions in this code:

- DFS with k distance.
- StepDown function (Get the k distance children).
- Main function

### Main function

```js:main.js showLineNumbers

function distanceK(root: TreeNode | null, target: TreeNode | null, k: number): number[] {
  const ans = [];
  dfs(root, target, k, ans );
  return ans;
};

```

### DFS function

```js:main.js>dfs showLineNumbers

const dfs = (node:TreeNode, target:TreeNode,  givenK:number, ans:number[]) => {
  if(!node) return null;

  if(node == target){
    stepDown(target, givenK, ans);

    return givenK - 1;
  }

  const leftLevel = dfs(node.left, target,  givenK, ans);
  const rightLevel = dfs(node.right, target,  givenK, ans);

  if(leftLevel ==0 || rightLevel ==0) {
    ans.push(node.val);

    return null;
  }

  if(leftLevel != null){
    stepDown(node.right, leftLevel - 1, ans);
    return leftLevel - 1;
  }

  if(rightLevel != null){
    stepDown(node.left, rightLevel - 1, ans);
    return rightLevel - 1;
  }

  return null;

}

```

### StepDown function

```js:main.js>stepDown showLineNumbers

const stepDown = (node: TreeNode| null, k:number, ans:number[]) => {
  if(!node) return;

  if(k == 0)
    return ans.push(node.val);

  stepDown(node.left, k-1, ans);
  stepDown(node.right, k-1, ans);
}

```
