# Excel Sheet Column Title

Given an integer columnNumber, return its corresponding column title as it appears in an Excel sheet.

```txt:example.txt

For example:

  A -> 1
  B -> 2
  C -> 3
  ...
  Z -> 26
  AA -> 27
  AB -> 28
  ...

Example 1:

Input: columnNumber = 28
Output: "AB"

Example 2:

Input: columnNumber = 701
Output: "ZY"

```

# Solution

We can break the problem into these steps:

- Map 1 - 26 numbers to the alphabet
- Introduce the base 26 system.
- Mapping numbers to the alphabet using base 26.

Initially, to `map 1 - 26 numbers to the alphabet`, we could use a map where the key would be the number and the value would be the letter; however, this is heavy in memory. Alternatively, we could also use an ASCII table. Looking at the ASCII table, A starts at 65. So if our number is 1, we could get the alphabet letter by converting `64 + 1`.

Now that we know how to use the ASCII table to map, our next problem would be `introducing the base 26 system`. Suppose we were using the base 10 system, and our number was 14, to get the number 4, we could calculate it by doing **14 % 10**. And to reduce it, we do **Math.floor(14 / 10)**. So similarly, we could do numbers % 26 and number / 26 in this problem. This method introduces base 26 and also reduces the number.

The final part is `mapping numbers to the alphabet`. Suppose our number is 701. 701 % 26 would give us 25, which would map to Y. After finding the first letter, we reduce it by doing 701 / 26, which would provide us with 26, which maps to Z. We keep doing this till our number after division is less or equal to 26.

```js:solution.ts showLineNumbers

function convertToTitle(num: number): string {
  let letter = "";

  while(num > 26){

    let newLetter = num % 26 || 26;
    num = Math.floor(num / 26) - (num % 26 == 0 ? 1 : 0);
    letter += String.fromCharCode(newLetter + 64);
  }

  letter += String.fromCharCode(num + 64);

  letter  = letter.split("").reverse().join("");

  return letter;
};

```
