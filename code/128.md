## Question

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

```txt:example showLineNumbers

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9

```

## Answer

Looking at the examples, we know that the sequence always starts with the smallest element in front.
In the example one, the 3 sequences are [1, 2, 3, 4], [100], and [200].
The first solution that came to my mind was to use sorting and then find the sequence, however, we can't use sorting since that would give us O(nlogn) time.

If we can draw the numbers up on a scale, it might look way easier.

Take a minute and look at the picture. To know if we are at the start of a sequence, we just need to make sure that `el - 1` doesn't exist in the sequence. Checking elements would be O(1) if we use a **hashset**.

And once we reach the start of the element we could just keep going forward till there is no next element and compare the current sequence length with our max sequence length.

```js:solution.js showLineNumbers

/**
 *  Time: O(n)
 *  Space: O(n)
*/

var longestConsecutive = function(nums) {

    let res = 0;
    const set = new Set();

    // To put each elements in the set

    nums.forEach(el => {
        set.add(el);
    })

    // now checking if an element is start of a sequence
    // Then finding the length of the sequence

    nums.forEach(el => {
        if(set.has(el - 1)) return;

        let seq = 1;

        while(true){
            if(set.has(++el)) seq++;
            else break; ;
        }

        res = Math.max(seq, res)
    })

    return res;

};

```
