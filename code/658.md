## Question

Given a sorted integer array arr, two integers k and x, return the k closest integers to x in the array.
The result should also be sorted in ascending order.

An integer `a` is closer to x than an integer `b` if:

- `|a - x| < |b - x|`
- `|a - x| == |b - x| and a < b`

```txt:examples showLineNumbers

Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 4, x = 3
Output: [1,2,3,4]

Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 4, x = -1
Output: [1,2,3,4]

```

## Answer

Looking at the example `|a - x| < |b - x|` makes me wonder what a and b is. By relating it, I figured it would be 2, 4 from the example.
The abs of 2 and 4 will be one if x is 3. So, in that case, we consider 2 to be close since `a < b`.

My next question is, how do I find 2 and 4? Which now gives me an idea of using two-pointers. But how do I use the two-pointers? Where should they start?

Take a few minutes to look at the input and come back.

My approach would be to iterate through the list and find the smallestIndex which has the smallest abs and start your pointers from there.
left = smallestIndex - 1, right = smallestIndex + 1. Now we keep checking if either arr[left] or arr[right] has smaller abs. If the left has smaller abs, we append arr[left] to the left side in res arr and decrement left by one. Vice versa, increment right by one and push it on the right side to put the res in sorted order. Keep doing this till our res.length == k.

There is one edge case with our approach, though. Suppose either left index is out of bound; we append the right elements to the right side of the res array, vise versa, append left elements to the left side of the array.

```js:solution.js showLineNumbers

/**
 * @param {number[]} arr
 * @param {number} k
 * @param {number} x
 * @return {number[]}
 */

var findClosestElements = function(arr, k, x) {

    let startIndex = 0;
    let smallestAbs = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;

    // For finding the smallestAbsIndex

    arr.forEach((el, index) => {
        const elAbs = Math.abs(el - x);

        if(elAbs < smallestAbs){
            startIndex = index;
            smallestAbs = elAbs;
        }

    })

    // by default the smallestAbs el would go into the res arr

    const res = [arr[startIndex]];

    let left = startIndex - 1;
    let right = startIndex + 1;

    while(res.length < k){

        // if right is outta bound then we add left side elements

        if(arr[right] == undefined) {
            res.unshift(arr[left--]);
            continue;
        }

        // if left is outta bound then we add the right side elements

        if(arr[left] == undefined){
            res.push(arr[right++]);
            continue;
        }

        let leftAbs = Math.abs(arr[left] - x);
        let rightAbs = Math.abs(arr[right] - x);

        if(leftAbs <= rightAbs) res.unshift(arr[left--])
        else res.push(arr[right++])

    }

    return res;
};

```
