## Question

You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times.

Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.

```txt:examples showLineNumbers

Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.

Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.

```

## Answer

For example, if we have an input ABAB and k = 2, our replacements could be either A or B to get four as our output, i.e., AAAA or BBBB. The questions look a bit complicated if we have to assume we are replacing either A's or B's, in general, all other alphabets.

Straight out of the bat, I know this is a sliding window question since I did a lot on them, but no worries if you didn't get that idea. Take a moment and think how this could be a sliding window question.

Let me give a few examples before I proceed to the question. Suppose we have an input AABBAB and k = 1. And our window lines from index 0 to 3 (AAB). To know how many replacements we used, we could do the size of the window - the number of max occurrences of a letter. That is `3 - 2 = 1`, Which means we used 1 replacement in the window AAB. As long as we don't go to a negative number of replacements, we can keep increasing the window and compare the maxSize whenever we get to a point with no more replacements, and we need one to continue the window.

```js:solution.js showLineNumbers

/**
 * Time: O(n)
 * Space: O(n)
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */

var characterReplacement = function(s, k) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = 0;
    const map = new Map();
    map.set(s[0], 1);
    let maxSize = -1;

    while(right < s.length){
        const keys = [...map.keys()];
        let maxOcc = -1;
        const window = right - left + 1;

        // To find the max occurrence of a number in the window

        keys.forEach(key => {
            maxOcc = Math.max(map.get(key), maxOcc);
        })

        // as long as we didn't use more replacements than k,
        // We are good to go.

        if(window - maxOcc <= k){
            right++;

            if(map.has(s[right])) map.set(s[right], map.get(s[right]) + 1);
            else map.set(s[right], 1);
        }else{
            maxSize = Math.max(maxSize, window - 1);
            map.set(s[left], map.get(s[left]) - 1);
            left++;
        }
    }

    // Suppose we never fall in the else statement,
    // our maxSize never changes.

    return Math.max(maxSize, right - left);
};

```
