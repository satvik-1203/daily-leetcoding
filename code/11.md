## Question

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

> Notice that you may not slant the container.

```txt:example showLineNumbers

Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7].
In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

```

## Answer

What are the parameters that the area depend on? The height of the line and the base length is what comes to my mind.
Height of the line - Smaller line between the 2 lines since water overflows.

So the brute force would be for every line find the area with every other line and which ever gives the max area would be our answer.

Since we are doing repeated computations, there is always a faster way to solve the question.

So suppose you have 2 pointers, one on the extreme left, and other on the extreme right.
Keep looping till `left < right`.
Find the area of between 2 lines, and check with the max, then change the line thats smaller.
If we are going close and you move the line that bigger, you are going to lose both base and height.
But moving the smaller height would give you chances to encounter a larger height at a close distance.

Keep doing that and at one point you could find your max area.

```js:solution.js showLineNumbers

/**
 * Time: O(n)
 * Space: O(1)
 * @param {number[]} heights
 * @return {number}
 */

var maxArea = function(heights) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = heights.length - 1;

    let maxArea = 0;

    while(left < right){
        let currArea = (right - left) * (Math.min(heights[left], heights[right]));
        maxArea = Math.max(currArea, maxArea);

        if(heights[left] > heights[right]) right--;
        else left++;
    }

    return maxArea;
};

```
