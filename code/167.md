## Question

Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
Let these two numbers be`numbers[index1]` and `numbers[index2]` where `1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length`.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array `[index1, index2]` of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

> Your solution must use only constant extra space.

```txt:examples showLineNumbers

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9

Output: [1,2]

Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

```

## Answer

This is prolly the most popular question out there haha.
There are multiple ways to solve this, you could use a hashmap, iterate through the entire loop for every element to find its pair, or use 2 pointers.

If we weren't given sorted array and we want still want the solution in `O(n)` time, we could use an hashset. Since the array is sorted we could just use binary search and `two pointers`.

The idea of two pointers is that, one of them starts in the front of the array, and the other starts at the end of the array. If sum of both elements are greater than our target sum, it means that we need a totalSum thats lower.
We know that to reduce the sum, we could just move the right pointer one step to the left, so we select a smaller element. If our sum is lower than target sum, we move the left pointer a step forward. Keep doing this till we find the pair :).

```js:solution.js showLineNumbers

/**
 * Time: O(n)
 * Space: O(1)
 * /

/**
 * @param {number[]} numbers
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var twoSum = function(numbers, target) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = numbers.length - 1;

    while(left < right){
        let sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];

        if(sum == target)
            return [left + 1, right + 1];

        if(sum > target) right--;
        else left++
    }
};
```
