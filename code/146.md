## Question

Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.

Implement the `LRUCache` class:

- `LRUCache(int capacity)` Initialize the LRU cache with positive size capacity.
- `int get(int key)` Return the value of the key if the key exists, otherwise return -1.
- `void put(int key, int value)` Update the value of the key if the key exists. Otherwise, add the key-value pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the `capacity` from this operation, evict the least recently used key.

`The functions get and put must each run in O(1) average time complexity.`

Input

  ["LRUCache", "put", "put", "get", "put", "get", "put", "get", "get", "get"]
  [[2], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3, 3], [2], [4, 4], [1], [3], [4]]

Output

  [null, null, null, 1, null, -1, null, -1, 3, 4]

Explanation

  LRUCache lRUCache = new LRUCache(2);
  lRUCache.put(1, 1); // cache is {1=1}
  lRUCache.put(2, 2); // cache is {1=1, 2=2}
  lRUCache.get(1);    // return 1
  lRUCache.put(3, 3); // LRU key was 2, evicts key 2, cache is {1=1, 3=3}
  lRUCache.get(2);    // returns -1 (not found)
  lRUCache.put(4, 4); // LRU key was 1, evicts key 1, cache is {4=4, 3=3}
  lRUCache.get(1);    // return -1 (not found)
  lRUCache.get(3);    // return 3
  lRUCache.get(4);    // return 4

```

## Answer

In my honest opinion, if you get this question, you should be perfect with the linked list and maybe even data structures. Since this question requires you to make a new data structure design, understanding the core concepts is the best bet for you in this question. The question asks us to do both `get` and `put` functions in `O(1) time`.

Don't get sad if you don't get this question; it took me 10 minutes to think about how I could use my data structures. My idea was to use min heaps where each key will have a counter to how many times they are accessed. And they are arranged based on the counter value. So the root of the min heap will always be the LRU key. However, putting in min heap would be O(log n), but we need one with O(1), so this isn't efficient. My other idea was to use a hashmap since they have O(1) lookup time. But using hashmap, it's still not possible to find the LRU key.

My idea to find the LRU keys is using a sort of array. Where the array's last element would be the last used key, if we do this every time we access keys, the first element would be the least used key. So now, to find the LRU key, we take the front of the array, which is O(1). And every time we access the element, we put it in the tail, again O(1).

Hahaha, you are probably laughing when you see it's that easy. However, using an array wouldn't work since removing the element at index(n) and putting it in the back is an O(n) operation in most languages. For this reason, we make our own array (Linked List).

It does whatever I explained earlier since the linked list is just references to the next node. Removing and putting them at the end would take O(1) time. However, getting access to the correct node takes O(n) time. We use a hashmap to make the time complexity O(1). The key would be the key, and the value would be the node of the linked list.

However, to remove a node from its current position, we need the node previous to it. So another headache, we have to use a doubly linked list to get the node, remove it from the current position, and add it to the end. And now you should be good to go. Just try relating everything I said.

Input:

    ["LRUCache", "put", "get", "put", "put", "get", "put", "get"]
    [[3], [1, 2], [2], [2, 4], [3, 9], [1], [8, 9], [2]]

Output:

    [null, null, -1, null, null, 2, null, -1]

LRUCache.prototype.get = function (key) {
  const node = this.map.get(key);
  if (!node) return -1;

  // If tail is the node we are accessing, no modification needed
  if (this.tail == node) return node.val;

  // Need to move the node to the end

  node.prev.next = node.next;
  if (node.next) node.next.prev = node.prev;

  this.tail.next = node;
  node.prev = this.tail;
  node.next = null;

  return node.val;

LRUCache.prototype.put = function (key, value) {
  // Since we need to move the node to the tail

  const exist = this.get(key);

  if (exist != -1) return (this.map.get(key).val = value);

  // If size is capacity, then we remove the LRU and add new node

  if (this.size == this.capacity) {
    let lruNode = this.head.next;
    this.map.delete(lruNode.key);
    this.size--;
    if (lruNode.next) lruNode.next.prev = lruNode.prev;
    lruNode.prev.next = lruNode.next;
  }

  let node =
    this.capacity == 1
      ? new Node(value, key, this.head)
      : new Node(value, key, this.tail);

  this.tail = node;
  this.size++;
  this.map.set(key, node);
};
```
