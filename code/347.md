## Question

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

```txt:examples showLineNumbers

Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]

Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]

```

## Answer

Just by reading the question your first thought would be to use a HashMap and track the occurrences of each number. But the problem comes after, how do we find the top k frequent elements?

You could use heaps, where key would be the the values of hashmap and data would be the key.
but putting each element into the heap and then removing k times would give us a time of nlogn. Which is the time of heap sort.

There is actually a simpler way of doing it and perfect for these kind of problems. `Bucket Sort`.

we could make an array of size nums.length and the index would be the number of times each element repeated. From the example one, 1 is repeated 3 times, so we put 1 in the index of 3. The problem we face now is, there could be multiple elements repeated same number of times so instead of storing just a number in the array, we could store it as an array.

```txt:example

nums = [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]

1   2   3    4   5   6
[3]    [1,2]
```

so now if we want k = 2 for the above example, we can start iterating from the back and fill the elements into our res array till `res.length == k`

```js:solution.js showLineNumbers

/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number[]}
 */

var topKFrequent = function(nums, k) {
   const map = new Map();

  // for getting each el occurrences

   nums.forEach(num => {
       if(map.has(num)) map.set(num, map.get(num) + 1)
       else map.set(num, 1);
   })

    const arr = new Array(nums.length);

    // bucket sorting

    [...map.keys()].forEach(key => {
        let index = map.get(key) - 1;

        if(arr[index]) arr[index].push(key)
        else arr[index] = [key]
    })

    let res = []

    // was lazy so I added each element into a big array and returned the slice(0,k)
    arr.forEach(el => {
        res = [ ...el, ...res]
    })

    return res.slice(0,k)

};

```
