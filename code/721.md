# Accounts Merge

Given a list of accounts where each element **accounts[i]** is a list of strings, where the first element **accounts[i][0]** is a name, and the rest of the elements are emails representing emails of the account.

Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some common email to both accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name,
they may belong to different people as people could have the same name. A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.

After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emails in **sorted order**.
The accounts themselves can be returned in **any order**.

```txt:example showLineNumbers

Input: accounts = [["John","johnsmith@mail.com","john_newyork@mail.com"],
["John","johnsmith@mail.com","john00@mail.com"],
["John", "john00@mail.com", "james1@mail.com"]
["Mary","mary@mail.com"],["John","johnnybravo@mail.com"]]

Output: [["John", "james1@mail.com", "john00@mail.com","john_newyork@mail.com","johnsmith@mail.com"],
["Mary","mary@mail.com"],["John","johnnybravo@mail.com"]]

Explanation:
The first and second John's are the same person as they have the common email "johnsmith@mail.com".
The third John and Mary are different people as none of their email addresses are used by other accounts.
We could return these lists in any order

```

## Solution

Reading the question tell me if one email links with any other email, then all email within that link is related to one user.
If A and B have one common mail, and B and C also got one common mail, which tells us that all the emails in A, B, and C belong to one person.
So imagine the links between A, B, and C as a graph. I said graph and not a tree since C can also have a shared email with A, which would be a closed graph and not a property of a tree.
After traversing all the emails, we can form multiple graphs, and each connect graph would belong to a separate person.
A -> B -> C would belong to person X; D < - >E would belong to person Y.

I'm hoping we are clear with the idea I'm getting at. Make each graph for each person. Then each connected graph would belong to someone.

Let's get to the coding idea. How do we make the graph?

![example img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/satvik-1203/daily-leetcoding/main/images/721.jpg)

We need to make something similar to the picture above. Firstly, each node has 3 features; name, emails, and children. Emails and children are both an array.
The children's array points to all the different nodes it is associated with. And also, observe one thing in the picture even though A and B have the johnsmith mail id, it's only present in node A.
I did this deliberately.
Since I'll be visiting johnsmith mail first at node A, instead of putting them in 2 nodes, I just wanted it to stay in node.

Now that I've explained how the nodes look let's understand how we can write the code.
So we will use a hash map first to get the node and make connections from one node to another. **Key: mail** and **value: node reference**.
Whenever we see an email that already exists in the hashmap, we will make a bi directional connection between 2 nodes.
And suppose we don't see the node, then we push the email into the **node.emails** and set the new key into the hash map `{email: node}`.
Do this to all the emails; by the end, you should have multiple graphs in the memory.
Which would give us the graphs you saw in the image above but in memory.
Now we do a DFS on the connected graphs and get all emails on each graph to the name **node.name**.
Ensure you also sort the emails, add them to the output array, and return the array.

```js:solution showLineNumbers

function GraphNode(name, emails = []){
  this.name = name;
  this.emails = emails;
  this.children = [];
}

/**
 * Time: O(n * m). n number of users, m emails in the user array
 * Space: O(n)
 * @param {string[][]} accounts
 * @return {string[][]}
 */

var accountsMerge = function(accounts) {

  // key is the mail addr, value is the node
  const map = new Map();
  const visited = new Set();

  accounts.forEach(account => {

    const [name, ...emails] = account;
    const emailValues = [];
    const node = new GraphNode(name, emailValues);

    emails.forEach(email => {
      if(map.has(email)){
        const emailNode = map.get(email);

        // Make a Bi-directional edge

        node.children.push(emailNode);
        emailNode.children.push(node);
      }else{

        // if email isn't in the map, then set it to the map.
        // email key, node as value

        emailValues.push(email);
        map.set(email, node);
      }
    })
  });

  const output = [];

  // Do a DFS, each connected graph is associated with one name

  [...map.values()].forEach(node => {
    if(visited.has(node)) return;

    const emails = [];
    const stack = [node];

    while(stack.length > 0){
      const node = stack.shift() // pops element from the start

      if(visited.has(node)) continue;

      emails.push(...node.emails);
      stack.push(...node.children)
      visited.add(node);
    }

    // Make sure to sort the emails

    output.push([node.name, ...emails.sort()]);
  });

  return output;
};

```
