## Question

Given two strings s1 and s2, return true if s2 contains a permutation of s1, or false otherwise.

In other words, return true if one of s1's permutations is the substring of s2.

```txt:examples showLineNumbers

Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidbaooo"
Output: true
Explanation: s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba").

Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidboaoo"
Output: false

```

## Answer

HAHAHA, the question probably looks tough, but once you understand the concept, it's straightforward. Suppose we have s1 = AB and s2 = ACBA. The output would be true since it contains BA, a permutation of AB. Alright how do we know ABC is a permutation of CBA. We could make ABC into a unique hash with the same hash as all its permutations. One simple way of making that hash is using an array of size 26; each index corresponds to the position of the alphabet. A -> 0, b -> 1 and so on. The hash of AB would look like [1, 1, 0, 0, ...,0], which would be the same for BA. Using this method, you can tell if two strings are permutated.

Now that we know how to tell if two strings are permutated, we need to figure out if s2 contains a permutation of s1. We could just use a sliding window. Each time we increase right, the new character is added to the hash; each time we increase left, the character is removed from the hash. And we compare the window hash with the s1 hash. If they are the same, we return true, else increase our window. Loop till we reach `right == s1.length`.

```js:solution.js showLineNumbers

/**
 * Time: O(n)
 * Space: O(1)
 * @param {string} s1
 * @param {string} s2
 * @return {boolean}
 */

const getHash = (str) => {

    const arr = new Array(26).fill(0);

    str.split("").forEach(el => {
        arr[el.charCodeAt(0) - 97]++;
    })

    return arr;
}

var checkInclusion = function(s1, s2) {
    if(s1.length > s2.length) return false;

    const sOneHash = getHash(s1);
    let left = 0;
    let right = s1.length - 1;

    // Initial Window

    const str = s2.substring(left, right +1);
    const strHash = getHash(str);

    while(right < s2.length){
        if(strHash.toString() == sOneHash.toString()) return true;

        strHash[s2.charCodeAt(left++) - 97]--;
        strHash[s2.charCodeAt(++right) - 97]++;
    }

    return false;
};

```
