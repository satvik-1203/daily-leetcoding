# Remove Duplicated From Sorted Array

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums.
More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.

Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.

Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

> The runtime should be O(n)

```txt:examples showLineNumbers

Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

```

## Solution

This question is easy, but it tricked me off, haha. It happens to the best of us, even if it's an easy question.
It is straightforward if you are going to be doing it in `O(n^2)` time; however, I need you to do it in `O(n)` time.
From the question, we know we have to use O(1) space and make in-place modifications to the array. We return a number.
The number represents the first k elements that aren't repeated and kept together after changes.

Since the array is sorted, we know a number is repeated if **nums[i] == = nums[i + 1]**.
Even if the number is repeated, we can't shift all elements to one position and move the repeated number to the back since we want it to run in O(n).
Getting this to O(n) is what tricked me off.

```txt:example showLineNumbers

  [0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 7, 7]

  [0]
  [0,1]
  [0,1,2]
  [0,1,2,3]
  [0,1,2,3, _]
  [0,1,2,3,5,_]
  [0,1,2,3,5,6,_]
  [0,1,2,3,5,6,7,_]

  [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, _, _]

```

Then I came up with this weird solution. Iterate through the entire array. If an element is repeated, make it underscore/undefine.
If we encounter an element that isn't repeated, swap its position with the first repeated underscore.
By doing this, we will always put the underscores at the end.

```js:solution showLineNumbers

function removeDuplicates(nums: number[]): number {
  let prev = nums[0];
  let startUnderscore: number;
  let res = 1;

  for(let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++){

    // If number is repeated, then we make it undefined

    if(prev == nums[i]){
      if(!startUnderscore)
        startUnderscore = i;

      nums[i] = undefined;
      continue;
    }

    prev = nums[i];
    res++;

    // If there is an underscore, we want to swap it and get the index of next underscore

    if(startUnderscore){
      nums[startUnderscore] = nums[i];
      nums[i] = undefined;

      if(nums[startUnderscore + 1] == undefined)
        startUnderscore += 1;
      else startUnderscore = i;
    }
  }

  return res;
};


```
