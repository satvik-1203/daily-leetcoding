## Question

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order,
and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

## Answer

My initial idea is to iterate through every node in the linked list, add the sum, and the once digit will be the new node's value. The tenth place would be the value of the borrower to the next iteration.

For example:
2 -> 4 -> 3
5 -> 6 -> 4
Ans: 7 -> 0 -> 8
Initially, the borrower would be 0, so to find the first node, we do 2 + 5 + 0 (borrow) = 7

7 ->

In the next step, 4 + 6 + 0 = 10. value = 0 and borrow = 1.

7 -> 0 ->

In the next step, 3 + 4 + 1 (borrow) = 8

7 -> 0 -> 8

Now take a moment and think how you would if the two lists were in unequal lengths. It should be straightforward, do the same thing but keep adding 0 instead for the smaller list after the elements are done iterating.

```js:solution.js showLineNumbers

var addTwoNumbers = function(l1, l2) {
    let borrow = 0;
    let newList = new ListNode(0);
    let curr = newList;

    while(l1 || l2){

        // If either list one or list two are done iterating, substitute zero instead of accessing value of it

        let sumNode = (l1?.val || 0) + (l2?.val || 0) + borrow;
        let value = sumNode % 10; // Once position
        borrow = Math.floor(sumNode / 10); // tens position
        curr.next = new ListNode(value);
        curr = curr.next;

        // if either list one or list two are done iterating, don't access the next of it

        l1 = l1?.next;
        l2 = l2?.next;
    }

    if(borrow)
        curr.next = new ListNode(borrow)

    return newList.next;
};

```
