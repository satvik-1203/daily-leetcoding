## Question

Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that `i != j, i != k, and j != k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`.

> Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

```txt:example showLineNumbers

Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
Explanation:
  nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
  nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
  nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.

Input: nums = [0,1,1]
Output: []
Explanation: The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.

Input: nums = [0,0,0]
Output: [[0,0,0]]
Explanation: The only possible triplet sums up to 0.

## Answer

If you haven't done two Sum previously, this thing could be a bit tricky but using the logic applied in two sum, this is a straight forward question.
If you have't done the two sum, you could click [here](https://isatvik.com/leetcode/167).

The brute force for this sum would basically make nested nested for loop. One for loop for the first pointer, another 2 for the other 2 pointers, which would give a time of `O(n^3)`, and you know thats really slow.
Lets think of a faster algorithm.

Sorting the array would take an `O(nlogn)` and what do we do after sorting? try using the same algorithm as two sum? How do we do it tho?
We can have a fixed pointer that iterates each time 2 sum algorithm ends.

```txt:example showLineNumbers

[-1, -2, 0, 3, 4, 5, 6]
  i   L              R

  we use 2 Sum algorithm till L < R, and once thats done, we could just increase the i pointer.

```

> Array can have duplicate numbers.

Since array can have duplicate numbers, on out first iteration, nums[i] = -1 and even on the next iteration nums[i + 1] = -1, we could just skip this. Since we saw all possibilities that starts with -1.
Same thing goes with L pointer. Once we find a triplet and increment L by 1, our L < R is still true, the loop still continues. If the element in L is same as the previous L element in the triplet, we should skip over it.
Since our output doesn't accept duplicates.

```js:solution.js showLineNumbers

/**
 * Time: O(n^2)
 * Space: O(n) // to get sorted array. Some languages do it in O(1) space
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[][]}
 */

var threeSum = function(nums) {

    const sortedNums = nums.sort((a,b) => a - b);
    let i = 0;
    const output = [];

    while(i < nums.length - 2){

        if(sortedNums[i] > 0) return output;

        let left = i + 1;
        let right = nums.length - 1;

        while(left < right){
            const sum = sortedNums[i] + sortedNums[left] + sortedNums[right];

             if(sum == 0){
                output.push([sortedNums[i], sortedNums[left], sortedNums[right]]);

                // We do want to repeat the triplet

                 while(sortedNums[left] == sortedNums[left + 1])
                     left++;

                 left++;
            }
            else if(sum > 0)
                right--;
            else
                left++;
        }

        // We do want to repeat the triplet

        while(sortedNums[i] == sortedNums[i + 1])
            i++;

        i++;
    }

    return output;
};

```
