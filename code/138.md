## Question

A linked list of length n is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or null.

Construct a `deep copy` of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly n brand new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value
of its corresponding original node. Both the `next` and `random` pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers
in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.

For example, if there are two nodes X and Y in the original list, where `X.random --> Y`, then for the corresponding two nodes x and y in the copied list, `x.random --> y`.

Return the head of the copied linked list.

The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where:

- val: an integer representing Node.val
- random_index: the index of the node (range from 0 to n-1) that the random pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.

**Your code will only be given the head of the original linked list.**

## Answer

The question is pretty straightforward. Just make a deep copy of the linked list. **Deep Copy** is just making a copy of the entire data structure where every node gets a new memory location and also references to the new memory locations.

Suppose in example 2, node one's next and random points to node two, and node two next points to null, and node two random points to itself.
Our deep copy would be to make a new node one and node two, then assign node one next and random to the new node two, same thing for node two.
Node two next points to null and random points to the new node two (itself).

We can do it in multiple ways, but the most efficient way that comes to my mind is to use hash maps and iterate through the linked list.
While iterating through the list for each node, I'll check if the current node exists in the hashmap.
If not, make a new one. Then do the same thing for the next, random, and link them together so they reference the new nodes.

Since random can point to any node near the tail, nodes could be made before we visit them in iterating to the list. So we want to check if nodes exists for curr, next and random before we assign them.

```js:solution.js showLineNumbers

/**
 * Time: O(n)
 * Space: O(n)
 * @param {Node} head
 * @return {Node}
 */

var copyRandomList = function(head) {
    const map = new Map();
    let curr = head;

    while(curr){

        // gets the cloned node
        let clonedCurr = map.get(curr);

        // If clonedCurr doesn't exist, we want to make a new one.

        if(!clonedCurr){
            clonedCurr = new Node(curr.val);
            map.set(curr, clonedCurr);
        }

        // Gets the cloned next, if no cloned next, make one and put it in the map
        // else assign it to the node

        if(curr.next){
            clonedCurr.next = map.get(curr.next)

            if(!clonedCurr.next){
                clonedCurr.next = new Node(curr.next.val);
                map.set(curr.next, clonedCurr.next);
            }
        }else clonedCurr.next = null;

        // Gets the cloned random, if no cloned random, make one and put it in the map
        // else assign it to the node

        if(curr.random){
            clonedCurr.random = map.get(curr.random);

            if(!clonedCurr.random){
                clonedCurr.random = new Node(curr.random.val);
                map.set(curr.random, clonedCurr.random);
            }
        }else clonedCurr.random = null;

        curr = curr.next;
    }

    return map.get(head);
};

```
