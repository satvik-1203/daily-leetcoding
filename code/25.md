## Question

Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

```txt:examples showLineNumbers

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]
// [1, 2] group, [3, 4] group. reverse them and join together

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]

```

## Answer

Let's understand the question before we solve it. We are given a linked list and the size of the group k, and we have to reverse the linked list in the k-group.
Before we do this question, I advise you to know how to reverse a linked list, as I'll not explain the process in this blog.

Suppose we have a linked list 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 and k as 3. Our output would be 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 4. Since the groups are 1, 2, 3 and 4, 5, 6, reverse them and join them together.

After understanding the question, it seems pretty straightforward. We get a linked list of size k, reverse the linked list and join them together. Keep doing this till we reverse all k groups.

```js:solution.js showLineNumbers

/**
 * Time : O(n)
 * Space: O(k)  can achieve it in O(1)
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {ListNode}
 */

const reverse = (node) => {
    if(!node.next) return node;

    let prev = null;
    let curr = node

    while(curr){
        let temp = curr.next;
        curr.next = prev;
        prev = curr;
        curr = temp;
    }

    return [prev, node];
}

var reverseKGroup = function(head, k) {

    if(k == 1) return head;

    let curr = head;
    let currSize = 1;
    let parts = [];
    let currStart = head;

    while(curr){

        if(currSize < k){
            currSize++;
            curr = curr.next;
            continue;
        }

        // once we have a group, we reverse them and put them in an arr.
        // So we can add all tails at the end

        let temp = curr.next;
        curr.next = null;
        parts.push(reverse(currStart));
        currStart = temp;
        curr = temp;
        currSize = 1;

    }

    let newList = parts[0][0];

    // For adding all the tails together

    for(let i = 1; i <= parts.length - 1; i++){
        let prevTail = parts[i - 1][1];
        let currHead = parts[i][0];
        prevTail.next = currHead;
    }

    parts[parts.length - 1][1].next = currStart;


    return newList;
};

```
