## Question

You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

```
L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
```

Reorder the list to be on the following form:

```
L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …
```

## Answer

Alright, the question is pretty simple. So initially, think about the data structures you want to use in this question. My idea is to use a deque or hashmap, you can also do this using recursion,
but I prefer not to do it that way since it need you to understand call stacks.

My idea is to use a hashmap where the key is the index value, and the value is the node. Suppose you want the 4th node. We could do `map. get(4)`, and to get its pair, we could do `map.get(n - 4)`.

Now that we can access the node and get its pair. Once we have the nodes, we can do `temp = first.next` `first.next = second` `second = temp`. Since we want to continue the train after second.

```js:solution showLineNumbers

var reorderList = function(head) {
    const map = new Map();
    let curr = head;
    let index = 0;

    while(curr){
        map.set(index, curr);
        index++;
        curr = curr.next;
    }

    index--;
    let prev = new ListNode(0, null);

    for(let i =0; i < index / 2; i++){
        let front = map.get(i);
        let back = map.get(index - i);
        let temp = front.next;
        front.next = back;
        back.next = temp;
    }


    // Since we want to break the circular list
    map.get(Math.ceil(index/2)).next = null;

};

```
