## Question

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

```txt:examples showLineNumbers

Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1].
In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9

```

## Answer

This question looks similar to the [Container With Most Water]("/11") Problem I did earlier.

The initial solution I got was to use 2 pointers. left is going to start from a point where left + 1 is less than left. and right pointer would end when right is greater than right + 1. But however in some cases there may be points where there is no right + 1. However, my solution looked somewhat similar to this picture.

![solution 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/satvik-1203/daily-leetcoding/main/images/42_example_one.jpg)

The problem with this solution was to find the right pointer. Encountered ton of edge cases to find the required left and right.

Looking at the problem for a while, I figured out another idea. We have two pointers, one start in the far left, and other starts in the far right. we will also hold another 2 sets of variables which is leftMax and rightMax. leftMax basically tells the maximum height from the left and rightMax says the maximum height from the right.
Suppose rightMax is greater than leftMax, then the only possibility is for water to flow outta left. Vise versa for right. And for every position we could just do maxHeight - currentHeight. If currentHeight is greater than maxHeight, we just change the maxHeight. And keep adding the result into total area.

```js:solution.js showLineNumbers

/**
 * Time: o(n)
 * Space: O(1)
 * @param {number[]} height
 * @return {number}
 */

var trap = function(height) {

    let left = 0;
    let right = height.length - 1;

    let leftMax = height[left];
    let rightMax = height[right];
    let totalArea = 0;

    while(left < right){
        if(leftMax <= rightMax){
            totalArea += Math.max(leftMax - height[left++], 0);
            leftMax = Math.max(height[left], leftMax);
        }
        else{
            totalArea += Math.max(rightMax - height[right--], 0);
            rightMax = Math.max(height[right], rightMax);
        }

    }

    return totalArea;
}

```
